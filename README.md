# A-B-testing

A/B testing—also called split testing or bucket testing—compares the performance of two versions of content to see which one appeals more to visitors/viewers. It tests a control (A) version against a variant (B) version to measure which one is most successful based on your key metrics.

# Making Hypotheses 
Null hypothesis or H0:
The null hypothesis is the one that states that sample observations result purely from chance. From an A/B test perspective, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the control and variant groups. It states the default position to be tested or the situation as it is now, i.e. the status quo. Here our H0 is ” there is no difference in the conversion rate in customers receiving newsletter A and B”.

Alternative Hypothesis or H0:
The alternative hypothesis challenges the null hypothesis and is basically a hypothesis that the researcher believes to be true. The alternative hypothesis is what you might hope that your A/B test will prove to be true.

# Create Control Group and Test Group
Once we are ready with our null and alternative hypothesis, the next step is to decide the group of customers that will participate in the test. Here we have two groups – The Control group, and the Test (variant) group.

The Control Group is the one that will receive newsletter A and the Test Group is the one that will receive newsletter B.

# Testing
There are two types of errors that may occur in our hypothesis testing:

Type I error: We reject the null hypothesis when it is true. That is we accept the variant B when it is not performing better than A
Type II error: We failed to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. It means we conclude variant B is not good when it performs better than A

For testing either T- test or Z- test can be used: 
z tests are a statistical way of testing a Null Hypothesis when either: We know the population variance, or We do not know the population variance, but our sample size is large n ≥ 30. If we have a sample size of less than 30 and do not know the population variance, we must use a t-test. This is how we judge when to use the z-test vs the t-test.
